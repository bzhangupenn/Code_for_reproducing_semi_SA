# Code_for_reproducing_semi_SA
This repository contains code necessary to reproduce the results in the paper: A Semiparametric Approach to Model-based SA.

The csv file ``SWAY_dataset_war_politics_before_imputation'' contains SWAY data (Uganda: Survey of War Affected Youth) after preprocessing. The raw data is available at https://chrisblattman.com/projects/sway. 

We performed a multiple imputation with five replications and these five complete csv files are stored in the folder ``real_data_after_imputation''.
